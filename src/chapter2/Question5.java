/**
 *  You have two numbers represented by a linked list , where each node contains a
 *  single digit , the digits are sorted in reverse order , such that the 1's digit is ta
 *  the head of the list , write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as
 *  a linked list
 *  Example
 *  Input ( 7->1->6) + (5->9->2) . This is 617 + 295
 *  Output 2->1->9. That is 912
 *
 *  Follow up
 *  Supposes the digits are sorted in the forward order , Repeat the above problem
 *  Example
 *  Input : 6->1->7 + (2->9 -> 5) that is 617 + 295
 *  Output : 9->1-> 2 that is 912
